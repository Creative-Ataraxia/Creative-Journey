Before becoming a creative full stack developer, Roy has worked in real estate investment funds, derivatives brokerages, industrial engineering firms and law firms.

Equipped with skills and experiences acquired from the financial, engineering, and legal industries; He formed a strong belief that: the principal life skill is the ability to learn efficiently and solve practical real-world problems.

His interests are diverse: from deep learning with Pandas and Pytorch, to frontend UX development with React and Typescript and 3D visual experiences with WebGL, three.js, shaders, and blender. He looks forward for working with like-minded teams to create something wonderous.
