### HiðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Roy, a React Creative Developer. 

I absolutely love learning new skills and using them to practically solve problems. Check out my [portfolio site](https://creative-ataraxia.github.io)! Hope we can create together! 

Before becoming a creative full stack developer, Roy has worked in real estate investment funds, derivatives brokerages, industrial engineering firms and law firms.

Equipped with skills and experiences acquired from the financial, engineering, and legal industries; He formed a strong belief that: the principal life skill is the ability to learn efficiently and solve practical real-world problems.

Armed with this conviction, he took a full dive into tech around the start of the pandemic and have since discovered his passion for creation through coding. His interests are diverse: from deep learning with Pandas and Pytorch, to frontend UX development with React and Typescript and 3D visual experiences with WebGL, three.js, shaders, and blender. He looks forward for working with like-minded teams to create something wonderous.
