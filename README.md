### HiðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Roy, a philosophy student on a creative coding journey. 

I absolutely love learning new skills and using them to practically solve problems. Hope we can create together! 

Before becoming a creative full stack developer, Roy has worked in real estate investment funds, derivatives brokerages, industrial engineering firms and law firms.

Equipped with skills and experiences acquired from the financial, engineering, and legal industries; He formed a strong belief that: the principal life skill is the ability to learn efficiently and solve practical real-world problems.

Armed with this conviction, he took a full dive into tech around the start of the pandemic and have since discovered his passion for creation through coding. His interests are diverse: from deep learning with Pandas and Pytorch, to frontend UX development with React and Typescript and 3D visual experiences with WebGL, three.js, shaders, and blender. He looks forward for working with like-minded teams to create something wonderous. 

His other skill includes:
-	Native fluency in English and mandarin; conversational in Japanese
-	FINRA 63, 82, CFA lv2 license holder.
-	Exceptionally self-driven; burning passion for learning new things and apply them to real-world problems.
-	Acute business acumen: Experience leading team to build products from scratch.
